# Image Detection with CNN
## Description
This model can predict an image if it belongs to one class or the other. For training the model, I have used images of 8000 images of 
Cats and Dogs (4000 each) and used a test set of 2000 images (1000 of each class).

## Installation
Download the code and save it in same folder/directory as of your dataset. You can use the same Dataset for Cats and Dogs or you can use any other dataset. 
Dataset is strategically distributed in folders of training and trst and further into two separate class. Then Use any python IDE to run the code. 
You can view the accuracy of training and test set for each epoch. 

## Usage
This model can be used to train on two different types of images, say object A and B. After training, it can predict a image which is new to the model
if it is A or B with high accuracy.
